A very simple, proof of concept software rasterizer.

== ⚠️⚠️⚠️WARNING⚠️⚠️⚠️
This piece of code is just a proof-of-concept, showing how rasterization-based rendering works.
The code quality (especially the MATLAB part) is not very good, and both versions are very slow
(takes >1 seconds to render a 600 * 600 triangle, thus 180,000 pixels). For production purpose
you may want `llvmpipe` things instead.

== Overall workflow
* Run vertex shader on all input vertices
* Set the 4th dimension of all output `v_position`s to 1
* For each 3 vertex outputs, scan through the rectangle containing this triangle
** Interpolate outputs with barycentric coordinate
** Do depth test
** Run fragment shader on interpolated output, get the final fragment color
